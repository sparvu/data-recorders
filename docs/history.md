# History

## Authors

Data Recorders was a project established by Stefan Parvu during 2008 when working at Sun Microsystems Finland. It was the time, when Stefan Parvu's path intersected with Neil Gunther trying to learn and understand more about computer performance. Neil Gunther was invited in Finland to teach Nokia and Sun groups on performance analysis. What followed were many, long endless night calls between Neil and Stefan. Thats how data recoders projected started.

## The name
A name was selected at that time: System Data Recorder (SDR)

"SystemDataRecorder is simple to use for performance analysis, system sizing, and capacity planning in today's challenging business environments. Keep it simple: record server or application data, store it for long periods of time and analyze it.

Our project is built as open source software, based on concepts and methodologies from GCaP, simple to be used for performance analysis and capacity planning of computing infrastructure. SDR tries to find unique ways in performance visualization, cpuplayer, consolidation and performance analysis and in presenting data to users as smart and simple as possible."
