How and when to use Data Recorders. These are real use-cases how data recorders were used to capture the right data from different systems and applications or integrate them to different 3rd parties solutions.

## ICT
Simple to capture computer system, web and enteprise performance and inventory data. Centralize different data from various systems and applications. Learn how can you build your defense strategy using all this data.

### Get computer, web and enterprise service performance data 
### Centralize UNIX and Linux SYSLOG data
### Top 10 fastest web services
### Build your data strategy
### Keep track of the inventory data
### Operation Center Dashboards

## Weather & Environment

Capture and consolidate meteorological data from various sensors and devices. Get the indoor air quality from several wired IAQ sensors. Keep track of the city air pollutants and weather condition from professional sensors, devices and equipment. 

### Personal home weather stations using USB WH1800
### Vaisala WXT Data data consolidation
### Capture Indoor Air Quality Data
### City pollution using Vaisala air quality and weather data (AQT, WXT sensors)
### Automatic weather stations support for Vaisala QML data loggers
