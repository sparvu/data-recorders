3.Prerequisites

  o CONFIG_BLK_STATS=y, support for block disk device statistics

  o dbus

  o chkconfig, it is not mandatory but highly recommended

  o Ubuntu/Debian based systems enable cron:
      # update-rc.d cron defaults
      # chkconfig --list cron

  o CloudLinux will require additional settings to allow user krmx to
    access /proc interface. 

    Add the following for the /etc/sysctl.conf

      # allow krmx to access /proc
      fs.proc_can_see_other_uid=1
      fs.proc_super_gid=5000

    See here for more information:
    http://docs.cloudlinux.com/index.html?virtualized__proc_filesystem.html


4.Install

  Kronometrix can be installed using the RPM package management system
  found on all RedHat based installations. The data recorders
  and started automatically, after the software has been installed. The
  transport utility will not start automatically.

      dpkg: warning: while removing kdr, directory 
      '/opt/kronometrix/log/current' not empty so not removed


5.Start procedure

  5.1 Recorders

    We can start all data recorders using /opt/kronometrix/etc/rec
    script. Make sure before running that you are logged as krmx user

    As krmx user:
      $ /opt/kronometrix/etc/rec start

    OR

    As root:
      # /etc/init.d/kdr start

  5.1 Transport
  
    We can start sender, the transport utility /opt/kronometrix/etc/transport
    script. Make sure before running that you are logged as krmx user

    As krmx user:
      $ /opt/kronometrix/etc/transport start

    OR

    As root:
      # /etc/init.d/kdr_transport start


6.Stop procedure

  6.1 Recorders
  
    We can stop all data recorders using /opt/kronometrix/etc/rec
    script. Make sure before running that you are logged as krmx user

    As krmx user:
      $ /opt/kronometrix/etc/rec stop

    OR

    As root:
      # /etc/init.d/kdr stop

  6.2 Transport
  
    We can start sender, the transport utility /opt/kronometrix/etc/transport
    script. Make sure before running that you are logged as krmx user

    As krmx user:
      $ /opt/kronometrix/etc/transport stop

    OR

    As root:
      # /etc/init.d/kdr_transport stop


7.Raw data

  Kronometrix data recorders will write the raw data under the main
  prefix installation directory:
 
    /opt/kronometrix/log/current

  For every data recorder, one raw data file, having .krd extension
  will be created and updated. Every night, we rotate these krd files
  and store them under:

    /opt/kronometrix/log/daily


8.Configuration

  The main configuratin file, kronometrix.json stores information about 
  the active data recorders being used, the address where data will be 
  delivered for analysis. Additonal, certain recorders might have their 
  own configuration files, like: webrec.json, svcrec.json, rs485rec.json

  8.1 kronometrix.json

    This is the main configuration file, including:

    Logging section

    This is the section defining the base path and the location where all 
    raw data logs will be stored. This can be located on a local disk or 
    a remote LUN storage. Usually, this section, should not be changed or 
    removed.


    Transport section

    Describes all raw data files and their naming convention. Usually, 
    this section, should not be changed or removed.


    Data Platform section
 
    This is the section where users should defined where they want to 
    send data. The platform section describes the details of one or
    many data analytics platforms, each with own settings.

    All raw data can be transported to one or many platforms at the same
    time. Under this section we need to define and configure, the following:

      o port number, the port number default 80, or 443
     
      o hostname, IP or FQD of the platform 
  
      o protocol: HTTP or HTTPS

      o subscription type: cpd or amd or wcd. cpd means, computer performance data 
        and describes data belong to IT computer performance. There are many types
        of data subscriptions, each having its own type, metrics and summary 
        statistics:

            cpd - Computer Performance
            epd - End User Performance
            dpd - Datacenter Performance
            spd - Service Provider Performance
            wpd - Web Application Performance

           iaqd - Indoor Air Quality
            aqd - Outdoor Air Quality
            wcd - General Meteorology
            amd - Aviation Meteorology

        o sid: subscription id

        o tid: token id

        o dsid: to be let empty, will be automatically be computed

      
  8.2 Log rotation


Notes

  Kronometrix uses its own log rotate mechanism in order to be flexible and 
  dont conflict with the operating system.
